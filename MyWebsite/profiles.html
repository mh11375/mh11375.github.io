        <h2 class="socks"> Meet Danielle </h2> 
        <p> Danielle is newly single, having lost her partner to the Great Laundry Cleanse of 2019. She tried to move on but without Damien, it was hard to be a leftie in a right foot world. On the dance floor, it was always a diaster and she was rarely taken out as she would be too loose with herself, causing tragedy. She's hoping that MatchingPair will find her a rightie. </p>

        <h2> Meet Sparks </h2>
        <p> Sparks is a young one. His mate got into an accident with irreversible damage and had to be laid to rest in the Great Bin. As Sparks had rarely been out before this accident, he is a bit jumpy when out of the drawer. But he's very open to another relationship, be it with a leftie or rightie or ambivert.  </p>

        <p> Leftie has had 2 previous pairings but he is ethically non-monogamous and hopes to be in several open relationships. He isn't fussy about age, gender, right/left/ambiverts, etc He loves life and being out. He enjoys getting wet, cuddles and being blown around in the wind. While he may look conservative, he is anything but!! He doesn't mind standing out and his loud behavior often gets noticed. He may not be for the bashful. </p>
